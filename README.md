# CS4375-Machine-Learning
 Contains assignments from CS 4375


## Assignment 0

This is an overview of ML

## Assignment 1

This is an assignment to calculate mean, median, sum, range of a vector in C++ and
calculate the covariance and correlation between two vectors in C++. Reads in the boston.csv file.
The pdf attached summarizes the assignment and compares the built in functions in R to the ones created in C++ in this assignment.

## Assignment 2

1st pdf instructions:
    1. Create an Rmd notebook, name it Regression, with appropriate headings for your name(s) and 
date. Throughout the notebook use headings to indicate important steps of the assignment and 
use text blocks to explain what happens in each code block. Write a paragraph explaining in 
general terms how linear regression works, and what are its strengths and weaknesses. 
2. Select a data set from the web that has at least 10K rows and has a target column suitable for 
regression. List the source of your data in markdown. Perform the following steps with 
interspersed commentary and code blocks:
a. Divide into 80/20 train/test 
b. Use at least 5 R functions for data exploration, using the training data
c. Create at least 2 informative graphs, using the training data
d. Build a simple linear regression model (one predictor) and output the summary. Write a 
thorough explanation of the information in the model summary. 
e. Plot the residuals and write a thorough explanation of what the residual plot tells you.

f. Build a multiple linear regression model (multiple predictors), output the summary and 
residual plots.
g. Build a third linear regression model using a different combination of predictors, 
interaction effects, polynomial regression, or any combination to try to improve the 
results. Output the summary and residual plots. 
h. Write a paragraph or more comparing the results. Indicate which model is better and 
why you think that is the case. 
i. Using your 3 models, predict and evaluate on the test data using metrics correlation and 
mse. Compare the results and indicate why you think these results happened.

2nd pdf instructions:
    Create a second Rmd notebook, name it Classification, with appropriate headings for your name 
and date. Throughout the notebook use headings to indicate important steps of the assignment 
and use text blocks to explain what happens in each code block. Write a paragraph explaining in 
general terms how linear models for classification work, and what are the strengths and 
weaknesses of these linear models. 
4. Select a data set from the web that has at least 10K rows and has a target column suitable for 
classification. List the source of your data in markdown. Perform the following steps with 
interspersed commentary and code blocks:
a. Divide into 80/20 train/test 
b. Use at least 5 R functions for data exploration, using the training data
c. Create at least 2 informative graphs, using the training data
d. Build a logistic regression model and output the summary. Write a thorough explanation 
of the information in the model summary. 
e. Build a naïve Bayes model and output what the model learned. Write a thorough 
explanation of the data. 
f. Using these two classification models models, predict and evaluate on the test data 
using all of the classification metrics discussed in class. Compare the results and indicate 
why you think these results happened. 
g. Write a paragraph listing the strengths and weaknesses of Naïve Bayes and Logistic 
Regression. 
h. Write a paragraph listing the benefits, drawbacks of each of the classification metrics 
used, and briefly describe what each metric tells you
